"""
tools/pr_tool.py

Handles everything related to constructing and submitting pull requests.

Improvements over the original:
- build_pr_title now correctly classifies fix/feat/refactor/docs/test/chore
  based on keywords anywhere in the instruction, not just the first word.
- build_pr_body delegates entirely to the upgraded pr_description template
  which produces reviewer-friendly, collapsible diff blocks.
- create_pull_request returns the full PullRequest object so callers can
  access html_url, number, etc.
