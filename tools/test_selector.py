"""Utility for selecting relevant test files based on an instruction.

The heuristic is deliberately simple:
1. Only files that look like test modules (``*_test.py`` or ``test_*.py``) are considered.
2. The instruction is lower‑cased and split into whitespace‑separated keywords.
3. A test file is kept if **any** of those keywords appear in its path (case‑insensitive).

This is sufficient for the unit‑test in the task description and can be extended later.

def select_test_context(file_list: list[str], instruction: str) -> list[str]:
    """Return a subset of *file_list* that are likely test files for *instruction*.

    The function applies a two‑step heuristic:
    1. Keep only files whose name matches typical pytest patterns (``*_test.py`` or ``test_*.py``).
    2. From those, retain files whose path contains at least one keyword from the
       lower‑cased *instruction*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_list: List[str]
        A list of file paths (relative or absolute).
    instruction: str
        A natural‑language instruction describing the change or bug fix.

    Returns
    -------
    List[str]
        The filtered list of test file paths. May be empty if no matches are found.
