## Issue Type

- [ ] **Bad plan** — Planner decomposed the instruction into wrong or unnecessary steps
- [ ] **Wrong tool selected** — Executor chose the wrong tool for a step
- [ ] **Bad code generated** — Generated code is incorrect, broken, or doesn't match the instruction
- [ ] **Poor diff / PR description** — Output from `diff_generator` or `pr_tool` is unclear or wrong
- [ ] **Memory / context loss** — Agent forgot earlier context during a refinement (`POST /refine`)
- [ ] **Infinite / runaway plan** — Agent produced more steps than `MAX_PLAN_STEPS` or looped
- [ ] Other: <!-- describe -->
